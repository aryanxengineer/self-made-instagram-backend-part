# InstaPlay 🚀  
*A Scalable Social Media Platform (Instagram-Inspired)*

---

## 📌 Overview

**InstaPlay** is a full-stack social media platform inspired by Instagram, designed with **scalability, maintainability, and real-world engineering practices** in mind.

This project is built as a **resume-grade production-oriented system**, following **product-based company architecture and development standards**.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build a **scalable social media backend**
- Apply **system design + LLD concepts**
- Follow **OOP-driven architecture**
- Simulate **real-world engineering workflows**
- Design code that can **evolve from monolith → microservices**

---

## 🧱 Project Structure


Frontend and backend are maintained as **independent repositories** to mirror real-world product teams.

---

## 🎨 Frontend Tech Stack & Rationale

- **React** – Component-driven architecture and reusability  
- **TypeScript** – Compile-time safety and production stability  
- **Redux** – Centralized state management for API-heavy workflows  
- **shadcn/ui** – Pre-built, high-quality UI components  

### Why Not Next.js?
- SEO was **not a primary requirement**
- Focus was on **deep React understanding**
- Goal was to master **core React internals**, not abstraction

---

## ⚙️ Backend Tech Stack & Rationale

- **Node.js + Express**
- **TypeScript**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **System Design & LLD principles**

### Why Express Instead of NestJS?
- Desired **NestJS-like architecture without framework abstraction**
- Full control over **design decisions**
- Clear understanding of **how scalable systems are built from scratch**

---

## 🧠 Architectural Principles

- Separation of concerns  
- Class-based controllers, services, repositories  
- Dependency inversion  
- Modular feature-based structure  
- Easy onboarding for new developers  

---

## 🗄️ Database Strategy

| Database  | Purpose |
|----------|--------|
| **MySQL** | Strongly-structured, low-scalability entities |
| **MongoDB** | Flexible schema & evolving data models |
| **Redis** | Caching, rate-limiting, session optimization |

This hybrid approach mirrors **real production systems**.

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Security

- **JWT-based authentication**
- **Secure cookie strategy**
- **OAuth 2.0 integration**
- Token rotation & access control layers

---

## 👨‍💻 Engineering Ownership

This project is developed **independently**, covering:

- System design  
- Backend & frontend development  
- Testing strategy  
- Logging & monitoring  
- Code reviews  
- DevOps-ready structure  

The goal is to simulate **end-to-end ownership**, similar to a senior engineer’s role.

---

## 📈 Scalability Vision

- Designed as a **modular monolith**
- Clear boundaries for future **microservices extraction**
- Async-ready architecture
- Cache-first read strategy

---

## 🧪 Status

🚧 **Actively under development**  
Documentation, architecture, and code evolve together.
